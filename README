SQLoco is a SQL database interface for C++ applications.  SQLoco is modular, so
several different SQL servers can be supported.

This is currently only a pet project, and may never see full production.

This version supports:

MySQL
Postgresql
SQLite

Please report problem or suggestions to isaac at noscience dot net.

Notes:
This is Beta code.  Be aware that the API may change before the final release.
