SQLoco is a SQL database interface for C++ applications.  SQLoco is modular, so
several different SQL servers can be supported.

This is currently only a pet project, and may never see full production.

This version supports:

MySQL

Notes:
This is Beta code.  Be aware that the API may change before the final release.

On some platforms, you may get the following warning:

cc1plus: warning: changing search order for system directory "/usr/local/include"
cc1plus: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system directory

This does not adversly affect the build.  This will hopefully go away in a
future version.
