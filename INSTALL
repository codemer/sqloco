SQLoco - A C++ wrapper for SQL libraries
Copyright (C) 2002 Isaac W. Foraker (isaac@tazthecat.net)
All Rights Reserved

See LICENSE file for license information.

Requirements:

	An ISO standard C++ compiler (e.g. GCC 3.x).
	Client libraries for the target SQL databases.

Run

	perl configure.pl
	make
	make install

To run tests, you must use an account that has the create table privilege.
Tests are not automated at this time, as each database may require different
access.  E.g.

	cd src/test
	./test_mysql -u root -p foobar
	./test_postgresql -u foo -p bar

Notes:
	The tests currently require the SQL servers to be listening on the default
	TCP/IP port.  You cannot override the host or port.
